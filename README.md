Project Title: Weather and Web Search Tool Using MCP

Description:
I built a tool that lets users ask for the current weather in any location, and it gives live weather updates. I created the weather tool myself and connected it to a Language Learning Model (LLM) using MCP (Multi-Channel Processing), so when a user asks something like "Whatâ€™s the weather in London?", the tool gives a real-time answer.

I also added basic web search features using DuckDuckGo and Brave search engines. These are already built-in and help the LLM answer general questions like "Who is the Prime Minister of Canada?" by searching the web.

Key Points:

Custom weather tool to get live weather reports.

Integrated with an LLM using MCP for smooth interaction.

Added DuckDuckGo and Brave for simple web searches.

LLM decides which tool to use based on the user's question.

This project shows how different tools can work together with an AI model to give smart, real-time answers.
